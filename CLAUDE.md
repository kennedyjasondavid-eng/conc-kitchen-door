# DOOR — Kitchen DOOR

## HOUSE context
DOOR is one app in **HOUSE** (CONC shelter-catering ops; Hospitality Operations Unified System Engine). It sits **upstream of everything**: the resident registry + the active menu source. Pipeline: **DOOR → EXPO → HUB**; MISE/CODEX feeds recipe + allergen data *into* DOOR.
- Siblings: **EXPO** (`conc-kitchen-expo`, consumes DOOR's menu) · **HUB** (`conc-kitchen-hub`, daily board) · **MISE/CODEX** (`conc-recipe-hub`, recipe + allergen + cost source).
- Machine-global HOUSE map: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Ecosystem vision (the "why"): `…\OneDrive - CHRISTIE OSSINGTON NEIGHBOURHOOD CENTRE\~CONC Project Management Tool~\CURRENT\CONC_Kitchen_Operations_Vision_V42.html`.

## What this is
Daily operational interface for Rexdale shelter meal service. Staff enter resident changes once (intakes / discharges / restriction updates) and DOOR generates all plating sheets, dietary labels, and support files in one run. Allergen + anaphylactic routing checked **before** service.
- `index.html`, single-file HTML/CSS/JS, ~17.5K lines. **v25+** — no single `APP_VERSION` constant (per-feature `[DOOR vN]` console markers; `menu_current.json` `_meta.version` ~30).
- Live: https://kennedyjasondavid-eng.github.io/conc-kitchen-door/

## Architecture
- Single-file HTML; all CSS/JS inline; no build step.
- **localStorage = live state** (residents, queue, registry). The repo's JSON files are *snapshots* the push writes for the rest of HOUSE to consume.
- Screens are **tabs toggled by `showScreen()`** (`data-screen`), not routes. All UI rendered up-front.
- Recipe + allergen data fetched **live from CODEX** (`DOOR_RECIPE_DATA.json` off the recipe-hub Pages site); a baked-in snapshot is the offline fallback. **Allergen data is owned by CODEX — fix it there, never fork it into DOOR.**
- Compliance engine: **exclude-array** pattern. **Anaphylactic flags are sacred — never silently overridden; always surfaced in red with explicit acknowledgement.**

## Published data contracts (DOOR = menu + resident source)
| File | Consumer |
|---|---|
| `menu_current.json` `{_meta, weeks[]}` (`version` increments) | EXPO `loadMenuFromDOOR` |
| `menu_reno.json` (reno 4-week, LAN routing) | EXPO when `scheduleMode = reno` |
| `menu_overlay.json` (user menu deltas) | applied on top of `menu_current.json` |
| `routing_by_meal.json` `{ meal: {halal, regular, vegan, total} }` | EXPO portion math |
| `registry_summary` · `meal_swaps` · `recent_log` · `learned_nr` · `custom_tag_rules` · `special_meals` · `door_state` | snapshots / informational |

**Change a published schema → update the EXPO consumer in the same change set** (or stage via menu overlays).

## ⚠️ Reno-menu footgun (shared with EXPO)
`menu_reno.json` is **NOT** in DOOR's normal publish set — it's a static artifact generated from the Excel sources (`_gen_menu_reno.py`, in the EXPO repo). Editing the menu in DOOR's UI while in reno mode writes to overlay/state but **never reaches `menu_reno.json` on Pages**. One-off reno-menu fixes: (a) edit the Excel + regen, or (b) hand-edit `menu_reno.json` here — leave a `_meta.manualEdits` breadcrumb so the next regen doesn't silently undo it.

## Rules
- Single-file HTML; no build tools/npm/frameworks. Graceful degradation from `file://`.
- localStorage is the user's data; architect changes via seeds, user edits in-app.
- Push: `KitchenDOOR_Push.hta` (Save → Sync → push; auto-detects home/work OneDrive path). **OneDrive-only working folder — no second clone.**
- Future **HOUSE Phase 5:** SharePoint integration via Microsoft Graph API (post-renovation) — persistence layers are structured to swap to SharePoint calls one function at a time.
